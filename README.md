# BayesNetwork


Exercise done for course "Introduction to Artifical Inteligence"

## Exercise
Write a random data generator that follows the distribution represented by a given Bayesian network. This network describes the relationships between (zero-one) random variables and is given in the form of a description of a connection graph and conditional probability tables. For the assignment, propose a network with at least 5 states (different from the one in the lecture) and conditional probability distributions. Initialize the initial states randomly. Present the results of the simulation. Give examples of what such a generator can be used for.
